## Migration Guides

### Upgrading to v1.2.0

#### Breaking Changes
- `search()` method now requires explicit namespace parameter
- Embedding dimensions changed from 768 to 1536
- Rate limit headers format updated

#### Migration Steps

```typescript
// Old (v1.1.x)
const results = await client.search({
  query: "meeting notes"
})

// New (v1.2.0)
const results = await client.search({
  query: "meeting notes",
  namespace: "default" // Now required
})
```

#### Re-indexing for New Embeddings

```bash
# Re-generate embeddings for existing memories
npm run reindex:embeddings -- --model=v2
```

### Upgrading to v1.1.0

No breaking changes. New features are backward compatible.

---

## Deprecation Notices

### Scheduled for Removal in v2.0.0
- Legacy `/api/v1/store` endpoint (use `/api/v1/memory` instead)
- 768-dimension embedding support
- API key format v1 (migrate to v2 format)

### Already Deprecated
- ~~`client.store()`~~ - Use `client.upsert()` instead
- ~~`includeVector` parameter~~ - Use `includeEmbedding` instead

---

## Upcoming Features (Roadmap)

### Q1 2024
- GraphQL API support
- Real-time collaboration features
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Mobile SDKs (iOS/Android)

### Q2 2024
- Multi-modal memory support (images, audio)
- Federated search across workspaces
- Custom embedding fine-tuning
- Enterprise data residency options
