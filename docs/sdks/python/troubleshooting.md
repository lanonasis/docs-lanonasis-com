# Python Troubleshooting

If a Python SDK workflow fails, start by checking authentication, endpoint reachability, and payload shape.

## Common Checks

- Confirm your API key or bearer token is valid.
- Confirm you are using the correct base URL for the target environment.
- Compare your payload against the [API Overview](/api/overview) contract.
