# Go SDK

The Go SDK documentation is being expanded.

## Current Status

- Public Go-specific examples are not yet published in this docs set.
- The stable platform contracts are already available through the REST API and OpenAPI spec.

## Recommended Path Today

1. Use the [API Overview](/api/overview) for the canonical request/response contract.
2. Use the [TypeScript SDK docs](/sdks/typescript) as the most complete client reference while the Go examples are being finalized.
3. Use the [API Playground](/api/playground) to validate payloads and response shapes before implementing your Go client.

## Next Steps

- [API Overview](/api/overview)
- [TypeScript SDK](/sdks/typescript)
- [Python SDK](/sdks/python)
